# Umbraco Headless Backoffice Bridge

This repository contains helpers and components providing native javascript interfaces for the Umbraco Backoffice. The goal is to hide the actual implementation (currently angular.js), making it easier to migrate to another implementation in the future by only having to update this library.

## Bugs, issues and Pull Requests

If you encounter a bug when using this client library you are welcome to open an issue in the issue tracker of this repository. We always welcome Pull Request and please feel free to open an issue before submitting a Pull Request to discuss what you want to submit.
